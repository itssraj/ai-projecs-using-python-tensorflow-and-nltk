# Image-Classification-model-from-CIFAR10-dataset
Created an Deep learning unstructured ML model from CIFAR10 dataset using TensorFlow keras. Classified the image between 0 and 1, define the model architecture, compile and train the model using epochs value of up to 10 and evaluate the model

# Recommnedation system from the movie reviews and ratings and apply K NearestNeighbors model using bruteAlgorithm
  1. Load the avaialable market place dataset(movies and ratings csv files)
  2. Create an user-item matrix method to map the user and movie that user watched.
  3. Created a function to find the similar movies watched by users using KNN techinique.
  4. Created a dictionary to map te movie IDs to movie titles.
  5. Test the recommedation system.
 Given below is the test result for different movie ID and it's corresponding recommedation of movies listed based on the selection.

# Sentiment analysis for a sentence and for a completex moview reviews using NLTK tool
1. Perform an sentiment analsyis metrics using an vader_lexicon sentiement analysis tool which contains the intensity score for words and phrases. Entered an sentence
   and received and sentiment intensity score of pos: 0.535, neu:0.465, neg: 0.0 and compound score of: 0.784 basically which is an good score of the overall sentence.
    Given below is the different sentiment analysis score based on the input context.

3. Performed an sentiment analysis from a movie review and implemented a NaiveBayesClassifier model to predict the sentiment of the given movie reviews and evaluated    the test results and acheived a 87% accuracy.
   1. Prepare the dataset
   2. Shuffle the downloaded documents
   3. Define the feature extractor
   4. Train the classifier
   5. Test and evaluate the classifier
   6. Show the most informative features.
