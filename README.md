# Image-Classification-model-from-CIFAR10-dataset
Created an Deep learning unstructured ML model from CIFAR10 dataset using TensorFlow keras. Classified the image between 0 and 1, define the model architecture, compile and train the model using epochs value of up to 10 and evaluate the model

# Recommnedation system from the movie reviews and ratings using K NearestNeighbors Algorithm
  1. Load the avaialable market place dataset(movies and ratings csv files)
  2. Create an user-item matrix method to map the user and movie that user watched.
  3. Created a function to find the similar movies watched by users using KNN nearest neighbour techinique.
  4. Created a dictionary to map te movie IDs to movie titles.
  5. Test the recommedation system.
  

# Sentiment analysis for a sentence and for a completex moview reviews.
1. Perform an sentiment analsyis metrics using an vader_lexicon sentiement analysis tool which contains the intensity score for words and phrases. Entered an sentence
   and received and sentiment intensity score of pos: 0.535, neu:0.465, neg: 0.0 and compound score of: 0.784 basically which is an good score of the overall sentence.
    Given below is the different sentiment analysis score based on the input context.

3. Performed an sentiment analysis from a movie review and implemented a NaiveBayesClassifier model to predict the sentiment of the given movie reviews and evaluated    the test results and acheived at 86% accuracy.
